# Notes on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a pragmatic approach to handling psychological problems. CBT seeks to identify unproductive thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes, so they can be changed to more productive ones.

## Differences in Perspective
Psychiatrists consider self-deprecating thoughts, inactivity, and excessive sleeping as symptoms of depression.
CBT therapists believe that these factors partly cause depression, and that patients have the power to change them.[^Hofmann]

In other words, behaviors are linked to thoughts, and thoughts are linked to behaviors--forming a feedback loop. This loop can be cut and replaced with a better one. In this way, the patient is treated as an expert with the ability to change the problem, instead of a helpless victim.

## A short example
Paraphrased from Beck[^Beck]--A housewife hears a door slam. What happened?
- Her daughter is returning from school.
- The wind blew it shut.
- A burglar has just broken in.

If her knee-jerk reaction is to associate this event with a break-in, then it would cause fear. She would be more likely to react this way if she heard in the news of a string of break-ins, and less likely if she thought it was nothing.

By changing a patient's thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes, it is possible to change how the event is perceived. These thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes become unproductive when they cause a person harm and are viewed negatively by society. The cycle of adjusting from the unproductive to the productive is the core of CBT.

## Counter-Intuitive Non-Goals
The event leading up to a trauma may be _interesting_, but not useful.

Example: A "hold my beer" event has nothing to do with applying a cast to a broken bone. At the same time, not all "hold my beer" events lead to broken bones. Some people have stronger bones.

Essentially, traumatic events cause different problems in different people, if at all. The event may be the _cause_, but the trauma _maintains_ itself for different reasons, which need to be resolved.
